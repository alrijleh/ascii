PIC TO ASCII
############

This script requires the Pillow library
It can be installed with Pip or Easy_Install or can be downloaded at:
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.5.3

To use the script, move an image file into this directory then run ASCII.py

The set of characters used for shading can be found in letterset.ini. The
default letterset is "@%#x+=:- ". However a custom set can be used by modifying
the file to any string of ASCII characters ordered from darkest to lightest.
